# GPS/NMEA scripts

This repository will contain a shell script to convert GPS receiver output
into position and time data that can easily be processed by other scripts.

It's not yet written: on Ubuntu, I found programs which already do that,
and therefore I've abandoned this. However, I'm now mostly using FreeBSD,
and I might give this idea another try.

There is also some reference information, partly stolen from elsewhere.
